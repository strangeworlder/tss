# Molecules

Molecules are groups of atoms bonded together that form more complex components with their own distinct properties.

## Characteristics:
- Combinations of two or more atoms
- Perform a specific function or represent a distinct UI pattern
- Relatively simple but more complex than atoms
- May have some internal state or simple logic

## Examples:
- BlogHero: Combines AppImage with overlay content and styling
- Form groups (label + input + error message)
- Search bars (input + button)
- Navigation items (icon + text)
- Cards (without complex content)

## Usage:
Molecules should be modular and reusable across different contexts. They should be designed to be easily integrated into larger organisms.

When creating molecules, focus on combining atoms in meaningful ways that create components with clear, focused functionality.
