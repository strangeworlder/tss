# Organisms

Organisms are complex components composed of atoms, molecules, and possibly other organisms. They form relatively complex, distinct sections of an interface.

## Characteristics:

- Complex components that form a distinct section of the UI
- Composed of multiple atoms and molecules, and possibly other organisms
- More specific and contextual than molecules
- Often encapsulate significant business logic or functionality
- May have state management and side effects

## Examples:

- BlogPostCard: A complex card displaying blog post with images, metadata, tags, and actions
- BlogPost: A full blog post display with content and metadata
- Navigation bars
- Blog comment sections
- Product listings
- Header and footer sections

## Usage:

Organisms should represent relatively complex but distinct UI sections. While they might be more specialized than atoms and molecules, well-designed organisms can still be reused across different parts of the application.

When creating organisms, focus on composing smaller components to create meaningful UI sections that deliver specific functionality to the user.
