# Templates

Templates are page-level objects that place components (mainly organisms) into a layout and articulate the design's underlying content structure.

## Characteristics:

- Page layouts without specific content
- Focus on structure rather than content
- Define how components are arranged on a page
- Provide content placement but not the content itself
- May include content placeholders

## Examples:

- BlogLayout: Layout template for blog pages with header, content area, sidebar, and footer
- HomeLayout: Layout for the homepage
- ProfileLayout: Layout for user profile pages
- AuthLayout: Layout for authentication pages

## Usage:

Templates act as skeletons or blueprints for pages. They define the structure, but they don't include specific content.

When creating templates, focus on creating flexible layouts that can accommodate different content while maintaining visual consistency across the application.
