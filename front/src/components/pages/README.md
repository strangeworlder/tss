# Pages

Pages are specific instances of templates that show what the UI looks like with real, representative content in place.

## Characteristics:
- Specific implementations of templates
- Include actual content
- May fetch and manage data needed for the page
- Often connected to the application's routing system
- May handle page-specific business logic

## Examples:
- BlogPage: Specific implementation of a blog page with real content
- HomePage: Home page with actual content
- ProfilePage: User profile page with actual user data
- LoginPage: Authentication page with login form

## Usage:
In Vue applications, pages are often implemented in the /views directory and imported directly by the router.

For complex pages with extensive logic, consider keeping the core page component here and having a minimal wrapper in /views that just imports and uses the page component.

When creating pages, focus on integrating real content with templates while managing the data and state needed for that specific page.
