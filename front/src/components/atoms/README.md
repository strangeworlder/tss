# Atoms

Atoms are the basic building blocks of the application. They are the smallest components that can't be broken down further and serve as the foundational element of design.

## Characteristics:
- Simple, standalone components
- Can be used in multiple places
- Have a single responsibility
- No dependencies on other components
- Typically don't have any business logic

## Examples:
- AppImage: A simple image component with built-in error handling and size options
- Buttons
- Input fields
- Icons
- Typography elements

## Usage:
When creating atoms, focus on reusability and simplicity. Atoms should be designed to be combined to form more complex components (molecules, organisms).
