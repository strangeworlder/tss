# Blog Post Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the steps needed to streamline and optimize our blog post implementation, ensuring consistent structure and proper integration with "The Slow" feature. The plan identifies current issues, redundancies, and missing features, with clear actions to address them.

We are using a shared blog post interface that lives between the back and front.

## Current Issues Identified

1. **Inconsistent Blog Post Models**: Multiple different blog post interfaces exist across the codebase
2. **Redundant Fields**: Some fields are duplicated or have inconsistent naming
3. **Incomplete Integration with The Slow**: Not all blog post functionality properly utilizes The Slow system
4. **Missing Type Safety**: Some interfaces lack proper TypeScript typing
5. **Fragmented Implementation**: Blog post logic is spread across multiple services without a central source of truth
