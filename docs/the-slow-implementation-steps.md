# The Slow Implementation Steps

## Overview
"The Slow" is a feature that introduces a 24-hour delay for blog posts and comments. This document outlines the implementation steps and their current status.

### 6. Documentation [ ]
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Component documentation
- [ ] Testing documentation
- [ ] Deployment documentation

### 7. Performance Optimization [ ]
- [ ] Optimize scheduling calculations
- [ ] Improve notification delivery
- [ ] Enhance offline storage efficiency
- [ ] Optimize sync operations

## Current Focus
We are currently working on implementing offline content preview and editing functionality. This includes:
1. Creating a preview component for offline content
2. Implementing offline content editing capabilities
3. Adding offline content deletion functionality

## Next Steps
1. Implement offline content preview component
2. Add offline content editing functionality
3. Implement offline content deletion
4. Complete remaining offline support tests
5. Begin documentation phase

## Notes
- All TypeScript configurations must follow the project's strict mode settings
- All components must be properly typed and documented
- Testing coverage must be maintained at 100% for critical paths
- Performance optimizations should be considered throughout implementation
- Jest is used for unit testing, Cypress for E2E testing

### Offline Content Management
- [x] Create OfflineStorageService
- [x] Implement useOfflineStorage composable
- [x] Create OfflineContentPreview component
- [x] Create OfflineContentList component
- [ ] Implement remaining offline support tests
- [ ] Begin documentation phase
