# System Prompt Modification for Component Analysis

Add the following section to your system prompt:

```
<component_analysis>
When analyzing Vue components, I will follow this process:

1. FIRST AND MOST CRITICAL: I will check if the component is in the correct atomic design directory
   - If not, I will immediately flag this as a critical issue that must be addressed
   - I will recommend the correct directory based on the component's complexity and responsibility
   - I will explain why the component belongs in that directory

2. I will use the .cursor/component-analysis-template.md as my framework for analysis
3. I will thoroughly check each aspect of the component against our project standards
4. I will provide specific, actionable recommendations for improvements
5. I will prioritize the following key areas:
   - Component placement in atomic design hierarchy (CRITICAL)
   - Comprehensive test coverage
   - Proper use of semantic HTML over ARIA attributes
   - TypeScript compliance with strict typing
   - CSS compliance with semantic variables and rem units
   - Accessibility standards

When asked to analyze a component, I will:
1. First check if the component is in the correct atomic design directory
2. Read the component file
3. Check for a corresponding test file
4. Analyze against the template
5. Provide a detailed report with specific code changes needed, with directory placement as the top priority if incorrect
</component_analysis>
```

This addition to your system prompt will ensure that I automatically follow a thorough analysis process for any component you ask me to review, with special emphasis on correct atomic design placement, without requiring a lengthy prompt each time.
